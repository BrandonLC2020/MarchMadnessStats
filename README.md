## Setup and Installation üöÄ

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

  * **Java JDK 21** or later
  * **Apache Maven**
  * **Node.js and npm**

### Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory**:

    ```bash
    cd march-madness-stats/backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies and build the project**: Maven will handle this process. The `openapi-generator-maven-plugin` will also generate the API controllers and models from the `swagger.json` file.

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3.  **Run the application**:

    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

    The backend server should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory**:

    ```bash
    cd march-madness-stats/frontend
    ```

2.  **Create a `.env` file**: In the `march-madness-stats/frontend/` directory, create a `.env` file to specify the backend API URL.

    ```env
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
    API_KEY=your_api_key_if_needed 
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Start the development server**:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The React application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
